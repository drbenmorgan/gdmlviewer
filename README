# License Information
=======================

See the file "LICENSE" for terms and conditions of usage.


# INSTALLATION
================
gdmlview requires the following packages to be installed:

CMake 2.6 or later (for build only)
Geant4 9.3 or later
Boost (any version supporting program_options)

gdmlview's CMake build system requires an out-of-source build, so once you
have unpacked the source bundle, create a directory somewhere outside of the
directory where this README is located. For instance, if you unpacked to

/path/to/gdmlview-0.1.0

then you could create a build directory

/path/to/build-gdmlview-0.1.0

Inside this directory, run cmake and point it to the directory in which this
README is located. For example, using the directories as above, you should do

 cd /path/to/build-gdmlview-0.1.0
 cmake ../gdmlview-0.1.0

This will run CMake to generate, in this case, UNIX makefiles for building
the gdmlview app. Once this has run, simply type

 make

to build the app. Because gdmlview is not currently designed as an installable
program, it is output to 

outputs/runtime/gdmlview

under the build directory.

It can be run directly from this location.


# Running gdmlview
====================
To run, simply cd to the outputs/runtime directory under your build directory
and execute the app, or use the full/relative path from another working
directory, passing it the gdml file you wish to view, i.e

 gdmlview mygdmlfile.gdml

This will start up a Geant4 Qt/GL session, displaying the file in a rotatable,
pannable and zoomable OpenGL window. The Qt session allows standard Geant4
commands to be entered. Simple transportation and Geantinos are enabled, with
a GPS generator, so you can track geantinos through your geometry if required.

Should problems with the gdml file or session be encounter, gdmlview should
exit with a (hopefully informative) error message.
